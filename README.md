# Info
This project primarily serves as a hobby project to improve my skill in writing applications in C, and isn't particularly interesting beyond that.

It features a small plane of blocks that can be interacted with by the user in a number of ways, including building, destroying, and a dynamic "explosion" that affects surrounding blocks based on a set blast radius.

The graphics are handled through the [raylib videogame graphics library](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib "Raylib github page").
